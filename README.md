# Welcome to samwestmoreland's homepage!

At the moment I use this page as an error log to document interesting errors that I've encountered and how I resolved them.

Error entries are stored in json format in the `error_entries.json` file. The json is fed into `convert_errors_to_html.py` in a Github Action which renders the HTML used for the site's homepage.
